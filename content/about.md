I made the bold decision to leave school during my second year of junior high because I dislike an education system that turns you into a machine without independent thought, merely following what is in the books. Instead, I chose to pursue my passion for computer science, and this journey has been nothing short of exhilarating! I dove headfirst into learning English and various programming languages, and I created my very first personal website, EProjects. I've since transformed it into this vibrant blog that you're reading right now! Here, I explore captivating computer science topics and provide beginner-friendly explanations to help newcomers navigate this fascinating field. Currently, Iâ€™m channeling my creativity and skills into developing my very first official video game, and I can't wait to share it with the world!
